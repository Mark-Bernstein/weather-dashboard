# weather-dashboard
This weather dashboard project was built for the UCSD web development bootcamp program. This application allows a user to search for any city in the world and it will return updated weather data in real-time for that city, as well as the 5-day weather forecast. The application uses OpenWeather's API to grab the weather data.

Code languages used: JavaScript, CSS, jQuery.
